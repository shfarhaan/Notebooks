    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science without communication is a black hole: nobody sees your work. A well-structured research paper is the “circuit diagram” for your ideas. These two sessions guide you through:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Paper sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion).\n",
    "* How to present experiments (tables, figures, plots).\n",
    "* Using references and citation tools.\n",
    "* Mid-course evaluation (reflect, check learning goals, refine projects).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lecture Notes (Key Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstract**: 150–250 words, last thing you write, summarizes the problem, method, results, conclusion.\n",
    "* **Introduction**: sets up background, related work, problem statement, contributions.\n",
    "* **Methods**: data, preprocessing, models, hyperparameters — *enough detail for reproducibility*.\n",
    "* **Results**: clear figures/tables, compare baselines vs proposed method, include metrics.\n",
    "* **Discussion**: interpret results, limitations, possible improvements.\n",
    "* **Conclusion**: 2–3 lines, no new results, just summary + future scope.\n",
    "* **References**: consistent style (APA/IEEE); use `bibtex` or reference managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Golden rules**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every figure/table must be referenced in text.\n",
    "* Avoid “data snooping” → keep methodology reproducible.\n",
    "* Tell a *story* (problem → method → evidence → impact).\n",
