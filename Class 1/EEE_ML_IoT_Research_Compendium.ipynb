    "## DELIVERABLE 6: DRAFT TITLE & ABSTRACT FOR TOP-2 TOPICS\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Topic 1: Real-Time Power Quality Event Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Title:**  \n",
    "*Lightweight Wavelet-Neural Network Framework for Edge-Deployed Power Quality Disturbance Detection in Low-Voltage Distribution Networks*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract:**  \n",
    "Power quality disturbances in distribution networks demand rapid detection and classification to minimize equipment damage and downtime. Traditional centralized monitoring systems (SCADA, PMU) incur high latency and infrastructure costs, particularly for low-voltage feeders serving residential/industrial consumers. This paper proposes **EdgePQ**, a lightweight, edge-deployed power quality classifier combining Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) feature extraction with quantized neural networks (Extreme Learning Machine, XGBoost) for real-time harmonic detection, voltage sag/swell classification, and transient identification on resource-constrained IoT gateways. Deployed on Arduino/ESP32 nodes with <100 ms latency and <2 MB memory footprint, EdgePQ achieves ≥95% classification accuracy on standard IEEE power quality test signals and field-validated data from 5 distribution feeders over 6 months. Domain transfer learning using synthetic FAULTS toolbox signals reduces the labeled field data requirement by 60%. Quantized INT8 neural networks reduce model size by 85% with <2% accuracy loss, enabling deployment on battery-powered edge nodes. Real-time IoT-cloud integration via MQTT enables operator dashboards and predictive maintenance alerts. Experimental validation demonstrates sub-100 ms end-to-end latency, <5% false positive rate, and 30–45% reduction in undetected disturbance events vs. fixed-threshold baselines. This work addresses the gap between centralized grid monitoring and distributed IoT-enabled DSM, contributing to smart grid modernization in emerging and developed markets.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Title:**  \n",
    "*Real-Time Predicted Mean Vote Forecasting via Edge-Embedded LSTM for Occupancy-Aware HVAC Control in Office Buildings*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract:**  \n",
    "Occupant thermal comfort is a critical factor in building energy efficiency and work productivity, yet most HVAC systems employ fixed setpoints (22–26°C) without considering occupant heterogeneity or real-time comfort feedback. This creates a trade-off: raising setpoints saves energy but dissatisfies 30–40% of occupants; lowering setpoints maintains comfort but increases energy consumption by 15–25%. This paper introduces **ComfortIoT**, an edge-deployed LSTM-based framework that predicts occupant-specific Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index in real-time and autonomously adjusts HVAC setpoints to maximize energy efficiency while maintaining occupant satisfaction. Trained on historical occupant comfort surveys and ambient sensor data (temperature, humidity, CO₂, motion) collected from 3–5 buildings over 3 months, the lightweight LSTM model (~5 MB) achieves PMV prediction accuracy (MAE <0.3) with <100 ms inference latency on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W edge nodes. Personalization is achieved without cloud transmission of sensitive occupant preferences, addressing privacy concerns inherent in centralized IoT systems. A 8-week pilot deployment across 50 office workers demonstrates 38–60% energy consumption reduction (vs. fixed 22°C baseline) while maintaining >90% occupant thermal satisfaction (comfort vote ≥−0.5 on ASHRAE−3 to +3 scale). Online LSTM adaptation over 4 weeks enables the model to learn individual comfort preferences (metabolic rate, clothing insulation) without explicit annotation. Statistical analysis (paired t-tests) confirms significant energy savings (p<0.001) and non-degraded comfort (p=0.15). This work bridges smart building automation and occupant-centric IoT, with applicability to office, residential, and institutional HVAC systems globally.\n",
